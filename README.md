# Contribution Guide
We welcome your contributions to the Life Optimization Manifesto! This guide aims to provide a comprehensive resource of scientifically-backed techniques and strategies for optimizing various aspects of our lives.

You don't need to know anything about coding to contribute. Basic knowledge of markdown, such as using # for titles, ## for subtitles, and [text](https://example.com) for links, is sufficient.

## Contribution Process
The contribution process consists of the following steps:

Research: Conduct thorough research on the topic you want to contribute. Ensure your sources are reliable, preferably scientific papers or reputable sources in the field.
Writing: Write your content in markdown format. Focus on providing accurate, evidence-based information, and cite your sources using markdown links. If you're editing an existing page, click the "Edit this page" button at the end of the page to access the markdown content. If you are creating a new page, just create a new file with the name of the page with the ".md" extension in the end.
Submit for Peer Review: Once you've written your content, submit it for peer review by creating a pull request on GitHub. Your contribution will be reviewed by other community members to ensure its accuracy and adherence to our guidelines.
Get Your Contribution into the Book: If your contribution is accepted, it will be merged into the main repository and become part of the guide.
