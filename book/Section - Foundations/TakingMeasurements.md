Measurement is a fundamental aspect of personal development as it provides tangible methods to work with. Various forms of measurement, such as blood-work, subjective analysis, and weighing your food, among others, can be utilized.

These measurements serve as valuable tools to guide your efforts in your personal development journey. They allow you to prioritize and address the most pressing concerns, uncover trends, and even prevent issues before they arise.
