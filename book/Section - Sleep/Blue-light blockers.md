# Bluelight blockers

### Sumary

Blue light blockers utilize glasses equipped with lenses that filter out blue light. The rationale for their effectiveness is grounded in how the human brain responds to the blue spectrum of light, particularly in relation to melatonin production and sleep regulation. Exposure to blue light, especially at night, can disrupt these processes. By reducing the amount of blue light that reaches the eyes in the evening, these glasses can enhance melatonin production and potentially make it easier to fall asleep.

### Summary of Evidence Level

We analyzed 2 studies (Both meta-analysis). Our review reveals that while the evidence supporting the efficacy of blue-light blockers remains inconsistent across meta-analyses, a holistic view of all studies indicates a modest improvement in sleep. However, the scientific confidence in these results is limited due to variability in study designs and outcomes. Improvements seem to be the biggest on people with sleep disorders.

Thus, we decided to rate this technique with a level of evidence of "3" with a level of impact of "2".
