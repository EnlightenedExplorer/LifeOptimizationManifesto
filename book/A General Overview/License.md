# License

The Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA) license is a flexible and widely-used open content license that allows creators to share their work while retaining copyright control. It consists of three key components:

1. **Attribution (BY)** : This condition requires that anyone who uses, shares, or adapts your work must give appropriate credit to the original creator(s) and provide a link to the license. They should also indicate if any changes have been made to the work.
2. **NonCommercial (NC)** : This condition prohibits the use of the work for commercial purposes. In other words, the work can be shared, copied, and adapted, but it cannot be used for commercial gain without the creator's permission.
3. **ShareAlike (SA)** : This condition stipulates that if someone adapts or builds upon your work, they must release their derivative work under the same license (CC BY-NC-SA) as the original. This ensures that the adapted work remains available for non-commercial use and requires attribution to the original creator(s).

The decision to adopt the CC BY-NC-SA license for the **Life Optimization Manifesto** project is based on several factors:

1. **Promote Collaboration and Sharing** : The CC BY-NC-SA license encourages collaboration and sharing by allowing others to freely use, adapt, and build upon your work, as long as they follow the license terms. This fosters a sense of community and enables the project to grow and evolve with contributions from a diverse range of individuals.
2. **Protect the Non-Commercial Nature of the Project** : By choosing a license with a NonCommercial condition, you ensure that your work remains focused on its educational and altruistic mission, rather than being used for commercial gain. This helps maintain the integrity of the project and its goal of empowering individuals in their quest for self-improvement and life optimization.
3. **Maintain Consistent Licensing for Derivative Works** : The ShareAlike condition ensures that any derivative works based on your project will also be released under the same CC BY-NC-SA license. This creates a consistent licensing environment for the project and its derivatives, making it easier for users to understand and comply with the license terms.

By adopting the CC BY-NC-SA license, the **Life Optimization Manifesto** project can benefit from the collaborative and open nature of the Creative Commons community while maintaining control over the use and distribution of the work.
